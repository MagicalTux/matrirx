MatrIRX II

by MagicalTux <karpeles@ookoo.org>

Currently, MatrIRX 2 is not complete. After a few months of work I concluded
that the things I wanted to do couldn't be done in PHP without some
optimization loss. So, MatrIRX 2 is released to the public as an incomplete
code. If you wish to work on this project, you can ask me an access to the SVN
repository.

You can also help on MatrIRX 1, as this version is still the most used one !

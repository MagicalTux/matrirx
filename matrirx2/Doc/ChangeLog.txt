************ Version 2.0.0

2005-05-27
	irc_unreal: fixed 100% due to partial implementation of socket_add/socket_del
	Removed debug output
	Wrote compatibility layer for PHP 5.0 - now the program is compatible
		with PHP 5.0 and PHP 5.1 !

2005-05-26

2005-05-24
	addons: fixed addon array being overwritten when killed
	irc_unreal: Now clearing irc wbuf on reconnect
	Fixed bad socket making select() return immediatly (99.9% CPU)

2005-05-23
	Implemented new buffered I/O for inter-process communication
		This has, however, reduced the answer speed from 3ms to 20ms
		The buffered I/O still need some optimisation (like try to
		write first, then append to buffer)

		will be used only when there's too much traffic

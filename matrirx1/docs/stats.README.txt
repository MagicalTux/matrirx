Stats
=====

This bot will join *every* channel on your network, and will log all activity.
It has some function, like announcing every 24 hours the url for the channel's
statistics, and various other use(ful|less) things.

NB: Due to a limitation in MatrIRX v1 architecture, changing the bot's name
will require you to also change all the function's names in the addons/stats.php
file.

This is *highly* experimental. Use at your own risk.
